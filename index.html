                <h2>About Curie</h2>
                <p>Marie Curie, née Maria Sklodowska, was born in Warsaw on 
November 7, 1867, the daughter of a secondary-school teacher. She 
received a general education in local schools and some scientific 
training from her father. She became involved in a students’ 
revolutionary organization and found it prudent to leave Warsaw, 
then in the part of Poland dominated by Russia, for Cracow, which 
at that time was under Austrian rule. In 1891, she went to Paris to 
continue her studies at the Sorbonne where she obtained 
Licenciateships in Physics and the Mathematical Sciences. She 
met Pierre Curie, Professor in the School of Physics in 1894 and in 
the following year they were married. She succeeded her husband 
as Head of the Physics Laboratory at the Sorbonne, gained her 
Doctor of Science degree in 1903, and following the tragic death of 
Pierre Curie in 1906, she took his place as Professor of General 
Physics in the Faculty of Sciences, the first time a woman had held 
this position. She was also appointed Director of the Curie 
Laboratory in the Radium Institute of the University of Paris, 
founded in 1914.</p>
<p>Her early researches, together with her husband, were often 
performed under difficult conditions, laboratory arrangements 
were poor and both had to undertake much teaching to earn a 
livelihood. The discovery of radioactivity by Henri Becquerel in 
1896 inspired the Curies in their brilliant researches and analyses 
which led to the isolation of polonium, named after the country of 
Marie’s birth, and radium. Mme. Curie developed methods for the 
separation of radium from radioactive residues in sufficient 
quantities to allow for its characterization and the careful study of 
its properties, therapeutic properties in particular</p>
<p>As a teenager, Curie made a pact with her sister Bronya: she would support Bronya while she was 
in medical school in Paris, and then Bronya would pay Curie’s way. From the age of 17, for six 
years, Curie worked as a governess and tutor, while attempting to study in her spare time. </p>

                    <h3>THESIS IN RADIATION</h3>
                    <p>
                        <strong>Curie decided to do her thesis on radiation, 
recently discovered in uranium by Henri 
Becquerel. She found that an ore containing 
uranium was far more radioactive than could be 
explained by its uranium content. This led her 
and her husband, Pierre, to the discovery of a 
new element that was 400 times more 
radioactive than uranium. In 1898 it was added 
to the Periodic Table as polonium, named after 
Curie’s birth country.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                         Then Curie discovered an even more radioactive element, radium, and, through observation of radium, made a fundamental discovery: Radiation wasn’t dependent on the organisation of atoms at the molecular level; something was happening inside the atom itself. The atom was not, as scientists believed at the time, inert, indivisible, or even solid.

                                For her research in <strong>“radiation phenomena”</strong>, Curie became, in 1903, the first woman to receive a Nobel Prize. French academics originally proposed only her husband and Henri Becquerel, but Pierre Curie insisted that <em>“we share the honour”</em>.

                                 In 1911, for the isolation of radium, she was awarded another Nobel Prize, this time in chemistry.<br />
          She was and still is the only person to be awarded Nobel Prizes in two scientific categories. By that time, Curie was world-famous, and the director of the Curie Laboratories at the newly established Radium Institute (today the Curie Institute).

                                Pierre Curie was the love of Curie’s life and 
her partner in science. They met in 1894 
when Marie Curie worked in Pierre Curie’s 
lab; they were married the following 
year. The couple had two 
daughters, Irène and Eve, and a few years 
after they married, Pierre Curie abandoned 
his own research to join his wife’s study of 
radioactivity. The Curies’ affair of the heart 
and mind ended tragically not long after Eve 
was born. In 1906, Pierre Curie was run over 
by a horse and carriage and killed. 

Curie believed scientific research was a 
public good and championed its utility. She 
and her husband had discovered that radium 
destroyed diseased cells faster than healthy 
cells, and thus that radiation could be used 
to treat tumours.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                During World War I, Curie promoted the use of 
X-rays; she developed radiological cars 
which later became known as petites Curies 
 to allow battlefield surgeons to X-ray 
wounded soldiers and operate more 
accurately.
                            </p>
                            <p>The Curies did not fully appreciate the danger of the radioactive materials they 
handled. Pierre Curie gave himself a lesion when he purposely exposed his arm to 
radium. Worse, however, was working for years in a poorly ventilated shed, isolating 
radium salts from tons of pitchblende ore.</p>
<blockquote>
   "I was taught that the way of progress was 
neither swift nor easy." 
<p class="caption"> Marie Curie</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Both Curies were constantly ill from radiation 
sickness, and Marie Curie’s death from aplastic 
anemia in 1934, at age 66, was likely caused by 
radiation exposure. A few of her books and 
papers are still so radioactive that they are 
stored in lead boxes. For example, Marie Curie’s 
notebook from 1899 1902, containing notes 
from experiments on radioactive substances, is 
still radioactive and will be for 1,500 years. It 
seems fitting that Curie left a scientific legacy 
that is literally untouchable. </p>

                    <p>  Marie Curie was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1903 alongside her husband Pierre Curie and physicist Henri Becquerel.</p>
                    <p>This recognition was given for their pioneering research on radioactivity, a term Marie herself coined. Their collaborative work built on Becquerel’s initial discovery of spontaneous radiation in uranium.</p>
                    <p> The Curies further demonstrated that radiation was not a chemical reaction, but rather a fundamental property of atoms — revolutionizing the understanding of atomic physics.</p>
